## Project Description

This is an Android app that controls an attachable smart lock IoT device remotely through a server hosted on a Raspberry Pi. The goal of this project is to create a more versatile form of lock that can be freely attached onto a wide variety of pre-existing door knobs and then controlled remotely via a smartphone application.

## Features
- Adjust device to most sizes/shapes of deadbolt locks.
- Monitor current status of attached lock in real-time from the smartphone app.
- Remotely lock/unlock the device from the app.
- Add friends with the app installed.
- Temporarily grant access to your lock to friends.
- Has compatibility for multiple locks. Locks can be freely 3D printed with their own unique ID, then registered on app startup.

## Installation
- Download the app via APK or from the Google Play store.
- Download the CAD model for the smart lock device.
- 3D print the smart lock and put it together.
- Open the app and complete the one-time registration form. The device is now available for use.

## Instructions
1. Attach the lock onto your door, with its grip attached onto your deadbolt lock.
2. Open the app. Press the lock button on the app's home screen to lock/unlock the device.
3. To grant others access to your lock, get them to download the Android app. Then, add them as a friend through their user ID. Afterwards, go to your friends list, edit their entry, and set a time frame where they will have access to your lock.
