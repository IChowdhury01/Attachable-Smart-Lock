## Project Description

A new, revolutionary IoT smart lock designed for improved portability and versatility. ItsMe locks can be 3D-printed and assembled at under $60, freely attached onto deadbolt locks with no required home renovation, and can be controlled remotely via Bluetooth with the ItsMe Android app. ItsMe's design is fully open-source, and can be modified to fit locks of any size for individual use. 

**The 3D-printable CAD models can be found [here](/demos/CAD).**
