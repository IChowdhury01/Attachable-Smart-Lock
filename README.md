## Project Description

This is an Android app that controls an attachable smart lock IoT device remotely through a server hosted on a Raspberry Pi. The goal of this project is to create a more versatile form of lock that can be freely attached onto deadbolt doorlocks and then controlled remotely via a smartphone application.  The lock's design will be open-source and thus modifiable to the owner's preferences, 3D-printable from standard materials, and require low-cost installation without home renovation.

## Features
- Adjust device to most sizes/shapes of deadbolt locks.
- Monitor current status of attached lock in real-time from the smartphone app.
- Remotely lock/unlock the device from the app.

## Installation
- Download the app via APK or from the Google Play store.
- Download the CAD model for the smart lock device.
- Purchase a Raspberry Pi model. For minimizing cost, the Raspberry Pi ZeroW is supported.
- Purchase a Servo motor. The Adafruit feedback 360-degree rotational servo is recommended. 
- 3D print your smart lock and put it together. Place the Servo Motor in the groove and wire it to your Raspberry Pi.
- Your lock's state is now being monitored through the app. Press "Lock" or "Unlock" on the app to control the lock's state.

## Instructions
1. Attach your device onto your door, with its grip attached onto your deadbolt lock.
2. Open the app, press "Turn Bluetooth On" and connect to your lock. 
3. Download the ItsMe SmartLock Android app (via APK or Google Play Store) and install it.
