## Project Description

itsMe is an IoT smart lock designed for improved portability and versatility, and low cost-of-installation. itsMe locks can be 3D-printed and assembled at under $60, freely attached onto deadbolt locks with no required home renovation, and controlled remotely via Bluetooth with the itsMe Android app. itsMe's design is fully open-source, and can be modified to fit locks of any size for individual use. 

**The 3D-printable CAD models can be found [here](/demos/CAD).**
